## Developer Workflow Guideline

### Working on Issues

1. Ask for assignment on issue
2. After being assigned an issue, use Github's [Create a Branch](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue) feature.
3. Checkout to that branch and make your commits
4. (Optional) Create a ["draft" Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) so that collaborators can add comments on code
5. Create a "ready" Pull Request and request review from repo maintainers

### Creating Issues
> Temporarily blank. Making issue templates first.

### Github Workflow and Actions
